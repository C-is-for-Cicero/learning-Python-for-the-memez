This repository contains code I wrote whilst doing The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications on Udemy. Sections 3 - 12 cover the basics but I wanted to include them in this repository to justify to myself that the money I spent was worthwhile :)

Section 13 and onwards are filled with some interesting bits of code, which you can peruse at your leisure.

### Section 3 - The Basics: Data Types
### Section 4 - The Basics: Operations with Data types
