This repository contains code I wrote whilst doing The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications on Udemy. Sections 3 - 12 cover the basics but I wanted to include them in this repository to be thorough.

Section 13 and onwards are filled with some interesting bits of code, which you can peruse at your leisure.
